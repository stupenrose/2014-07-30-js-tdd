Fast & Maintainable Javascript TDD: A Working Approach
------------------------------------------------------

Goals:
   - Give the attendees a flavor of how good TDD works in general
       - test first
       - the red/green/refactor flow
   - Give attendees a taste of how robust javascript code can be written with realtime feedback tooling
       - jshint, qunit & watchrun
   - Give attendees a taste of how a UI can be built using components & blackbox testing
   - Show off some of the tools we use
   - Show how /refactorable/ code can be when using blackbox testing
   
 Attendees should walk away ...
    ... convinced that it is possible to TDD non-trivial apps without sacrificing workflow & productivity
